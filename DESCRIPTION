Description:   This package replicates the game "Let's Make A Deal" where there are three doors for a contestant to choose from. One door has a car behind it and the other two have goats behind it. The contestant selects a door, then the host opens the door to reveal a goat, then the contesant decides to stay or switch to the unopened door. This package simulates 100 games to test which game strategy wins the game the most.
